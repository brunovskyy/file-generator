# üö® IMPORTANT: EXE Security Instructions

If you downloaded `DocGenius.exe` and it won't run, this is normal Windows security behavior. Here's how to fix it:

## Method 1: Unblock the File (Recommended)
1. **Right-click** on `DocGenius.exe`
2. Select **"Properties"**
3. At the bottom, check **"Unblock"** checkbox
4. Click **"OK"**
5. Now double-click to run normally

## Method 2: Run from Command Line
1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**
2. Navigate to where you downloaded the file
3. Type: `.\DocGenius.exe` and press Enter

## Method 3: Windows Defender Override
If Windows Defender blocks it:
1. Go to **Windows Security** ‚Üí **Virus & threat protection**
2. Click **"Manage settings"** under Virus & threat protection settings
3. Add `DocGenius.exe` to exclusions

## Method 4: SmartScreen Override
If you see "Windows protected your PC":
1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

## Why This Happens
- The EXE is not digitally signed
- Windows treats all unsigned downloads as potentially unsafe
- This is normal for indie/open-source software

## Alternative: Run from Source
If you prefer, you can run the Python source directly:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunovskyy/file-generator.git
cd file-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app_launcher_cli.py
```

The EXE is completely safe - it's just Windows being protective! üõ°Ô∏è
